# machine-learning

1. Naive-bayes
  Custom implementation on cleaveland dataset and its comparison with scikit learn implementation
  
2. Random-forest
  Custom implmenetation using bootstrapping as well as feature bagging on Pacman moves dataset (UC Berkeley AI implementation of pacman).
  Used Gini impurity as split measure.
  
3. synthetic-regression-analysis
